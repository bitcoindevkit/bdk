## [v0.24.0]

### Summary

This release contains important dependency updates for `rust-bitcoin` to `0.29` and `rust-miniscript` to `8.0`, plus related crates that also depend on the latest version of `rust-bitcoin`. The release also includes a breaking change to the BDK signer which now produces low-R signatures by default, saving one byte. A bug was found in the `get_checksum` and `get_checksum_bytes` functions, which are now deprecated in favor of fixed versions called `calc_checksum` and `calc_checksum_bytes`. And finally a new `hardware-signer` features was added that re-exports the `hwi` crate, along with a new `hardware_signers.rs` example file.
   
### Changed

- Updated dependency versions for `rust-bitcoin` to `0.29` and `rust-miniscript` to `8.0`, plus all related crates. @afilini #770

- Consolidate params `fee_amount` and `amount_needed` in `target_amount` in `CoinSelectionAlgorithm::coin_select` signature.
- Change the meaning of the `fee_amount` field inside `CoinSelectionResult`: from now on the `fee_amount` will represent only the fees asociated with the utxos in the `selected` field of `CoinSelectionResult`.
- New `RpcBlockchain` implementation with various fixes.
- Return balance in separate categories, namely `confirmed`, `trusted_pending`, `untrusted_pending` & `immature`.

## [v0.20.0]

- New MSRV set to `1.56.1`
- Fee sniping discouraging through nLockTime - if the user specifies a `current_height`, we use that as a nlocktime, otherwise we use the last sync height (or 0 if we never synced)
- Fix hang when `ElectrumBlockchainConfig::stop_gap` is zero.
- Set coin type in BIP44, BIP49, and BIP84 templates
- Get block hash given a block height - A `get_block_hash` method is now defined on the `GetBlockHash` trait and implemented on every blockchain backend. This method expects a block height and returns the corresponding block hash.
- Add `remove_partial_sigs` and `try_finalize` to `SignOptions`
- Deprecate `AddressValidator`
- Fix Electrum wallet sync potentially causing address index decrement - compare proposed index and current index before applying batch operations during sync.

- New MSRV set to `1.56`
- Unpinned tokio to `1`
- Add traits to reuse `Blockchain`s across multiple wallets (`BlockchainFactory` and `StatelessBlockchain`).

- Update `PkOrF` in the policy module to become an enum
- Add experimental support for Taproot, including:
  - Support for `tr()` descriptors with complex tapscript trees
  - Creation of Taproot PSBTs (BIP-371)
  - Signing Taproot PSBTs (key spend and script spend)
  - Support for `tr()` descriptors in the `descriptor!()` macro
- Add support for Bitcoin Core 23.0 when using the `rpc` blockchain

## [v0.18.0]

- Add `sqlite-bundled` feature for deployments that need a bundled version of sqlite, i.e. for mobile platforms.
- Added `Wallet::get_signers()`, `Wallet::descriptor_checksum()` and `Wallet::get_address_validators()`, exposed the `AsDerived` trait.
- Deprecate `database::Database::flush()`, the function is only needed for the sled database on mobile, instead for mobile use the sqlite database.
- Add `keychain: KeychainKind` to `wallet::AddressInfo`.
- Improve key generation traits
- Rename `WalletExport` to `FullyNodedExport`, deprecate the former.

## [v0.17.0]

- Removed default verification from `wallet::sync`. sync-time verification is added in `script_sync` and is activated by `verify` feature flag.
- `verify` flag removed from `TransactionDetails`.
- Add `get_internal_address` to allow you to get internal addresses just as you get external addresses.
- added `ensure_addresses_cached` to `Wallet` to let offline wallets load and cache addresses in their database
- Add `is_spent` field to `LocalUtxo`; when we notice that a utxo has been spent we set `is_spent` field to true instead of deleting it from the db.

### Sync API change

To decouple the `Wallet` from the `Blockchain` we've made major changes:

- Removed `Blockchain` from Wallet.
- Removed `Wallet::broadcast` (just use `Blockchain::broadcast`)
- Deprecated `Wallet::new_offline` (all wallets are offline now)
- Changed `Wallet::sync` to take a `Blockchain`.
- Stop making a request for the block height when calling `Wallet:new`.
- Added `SyncOptions` to capture extra (future) arguments to `Wallet::sync`.
- Removed `max_addresses` sync parameter which determined how many addresses to cache before syncing since this can just be done with `ensure_addresses_cached`.
- remove `flush` method from the `Database` trait.

## [v0.16.1]

- Pin tokio dependency version to ~1.14 to prevent errors due to their new MSRV 1.49.0

## [v0.16.0]

- Disable `reqwest` default features.
- Added `reqwest-default-tls` feature: Use this to restore the TLS defaults of reqwest if you don't want to add a dependency to it in your own manifest.
- Use dust_value from rust-bitcoin
- Fixed generating WIF in the correct network format.

## [v0.15.0]

- Overhauled sync logic for electrum and esplora.
- Unify ureq and reqwest esplora backends to have the same configuration parameters. This means reqwest now has a timeout parameter and ureq has a concurrency parameter.
- Fixed esplora fee estimation.

## [v0.14.0]

- BIP39 implementation dependency, in `keys::bip39` changed from tiny-bip39 to rust-bip39.

- Rename `ConfirmationTime` to `BlockTime`

## [v0.13.0]

- Exposed `get_tx()` method from `Database` to `Wallet`.

## [v0.12.0]

- Activate `miniscript/use-serde` feature to allow consumers of the library to access it via the re-exported `miniscript` crate.

## [v0.11.0]

- Added `flush` method to the `Database` trait to explicitly flush to disk latest changes on the db.

## [v0.10.0]

- Added `RpcBlockchain` in the `AnyBlockchain` struct to allow using Rpc backend where `AnyBlockchain` is used (eg `bdk-cli`)
- Removed hard dependency on `tokio`.

### Wallet

- Removed and replaced `set_single_recipient` with more general `drain_to` and replaced `maintain_single_recipient` with `allow_shrinking`.

### Blockchain

- Removed `stop_gap` from `Blockchain` trait and added it to only `ElectrumBlockchain` and `EsploraBlockchain` structs.

#### Added
Timelocks are considered (optionally) in building the `satisfaction` field

### Wallet

- Changed `Wallet::{sign, finalize_psbt}` now take a `&mut psbt` rather than consuming it.
- Require and validate `non_witness_utxo` for SegWit signatures by default, can be adjusted with `SignOptions`
- Replace the opt-in builder option `force_non_witness_utxo` with the opposite `only_witness_utxo`. From now on we will provide the `non_witness_utxo`, unless explicitly asked not to.

### Descriptor
#### Added

### Wallet
#### Changed
- `get_new_address()` refactored to `get_address(AddressIndex::New)` to support different `get_address()` index selection strategies

#### Added
- Added `get_address(AddressIndex::LastUnused)` which returns the last derived address if it has not been used or if used in a received transaction returns a new address
- Added `get_address(AddressIndex::Peek(u32))` which returns a derived address for a specified descriptor index but does not change the current index
- Added `get_address(AddressIndex::Reset(u32))` which returns a derived address for a specified descriptor index and resets current index to the given value
- Added `get_psbt_input` to create the corresponding psbt input for a local utxo.

#### Fixed
- Fixed `coin_select` calculation for UTXOs where `value < fee` that caused over-/underflow errors.

#### Added
- Added support for the `signet` network (issue #62)
