## About

The `bdk` libraries aims to provide well engineered and reviewed components for Bitcoin based applications.
It is built upon the excellent [`rust-bitcoin`] and [`rust-miniscript`] crates.

> ⚠ The Bitcoin Dev Kit developers are in the process of releasing a `v1.0` which is a fundamental re-write of how the library works.
> See for some background on this project: https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/road-to-bdk-1/ (ignore the timeline 😁)
> For a release timeline see the [`BDK 1.0 project page`].

## Architecture

The project is split up into several crates in the `/crates` directory:

- [`wallet`](./crates/wallet): Contains the central high level `Wallet` type that is built from the low-level mechanisms provided by the other components
- [`chain`](./crates/chain): Tools for storing and indexing chain data
- [`persist`](./crates/persist): Types that define data persistence of a BDK wallet
- [`file_store`](./crates/file_store): A (experimental) persistence backend for storing chain data in a single file.
- [`esplora`](./crates/esplora): Extends the [`esplora-client`] crate with methods to fetch chain data from an esplora HTTP server in the form that [`bdk_chain`] and `Wallet` can consume.
- [`electrum`](./crates/electrum): Extends the [`electrum-client`] crate with methods to fetch chain data from an electrum server in the form that [`bdk_chain`] and `Wallet` can consume.

Fully working examples of how to use these components are in `/example-crates`:
- [`example_cli`](./example-crates/example_cli): Library used by the `example_*` crates. Provides utilities for syncing, showing the balance, generating addresses and creating transactions without using the bdk_wallet `Wallet`.
- [`example_electrum`](./example-crates/example_electrum): A command line Bitcoin wallet application built on top of `example_cli` and the `electrum` crate. It shows the power of the bdk tools (`chain` + `file_store` + `electrum`), without depending on the main `bdk_wallet` library.
- [`example_esplora`](./example-crates/example_esplora): A command line Bitcoin wallet application built on top of `example_cli` and the `esplora` crate. It shows the power of the bdk tools (`chain` + `file_store` + `esplora`), without depending on the main `bdk_wallet` library.
- [`example_bitcoind_rpc_polling`](./example-crates/example_bitcoind_rpc_polling): A command line Bitcoin wallet application built on top of `example_cli` and the `bitcoind_rpc` crate. It shows the power of the bdk tools (`chain` + `file_store` + `bitcoind_rpc`), without depending on the main `bdk_wallet` library.
- [`wallet_esplora_blocking`](./example-crates/wallet_esplora_blocking): Uses the `Wallet` to sync and spend using the Esplora blocking interface.
- [`wallet_esplora_async`](./example-crates/wallet_esplora_async): Uses the `Wallet` to sync and spend using the Esplora asynchronous interface.
- [`wallet_electrum`](./example-crates/wallet_electrum): Uses the `Wallet` to sync and spend using Electrum.
