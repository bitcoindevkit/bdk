## About

The `bdk` libraries aim to provide well engineered and reviewed components for Bitcoin wallets and other applications.
They are built upon the excellent [`rust-bitcoin`] and [`rust-miniscript`] crates.

## Architecture

The workspace in this repository contains several crates in the `/crates` directory:

| Sub-Directory | Description | Badges |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| [`chain`](./crates/chain) | Tools for storing and indexing chain data. | ![Chain Crate Info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bdk_chain.svg) ![Chain API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs.rs-bdk_chain-green) |
| [`core`](./crates/core) | A collection of core structures used by the [`bdk_chain`], [`bdk_wallet`], and BDK's chain data source crates. | ![Core Crate Info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bdk_core.svg) ![Core API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs.rs-bdk_core-green) |
| [`esplora`](./crates/esplora) | Extends the [`esplora-client`] crate with methods to fetch chain data from an esplora HTTP server in the form that [`bdk_chain`] and `Wallet` can consume. | ![Esplora Crate Info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bdk_esplora.svg) ![Esplora API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs.rs-bdk_esplora-green) |
| [`electrum`](./crates/electrum) | Extends the [`electrum-client`] crate with methods to fetch chain data from an electrum server in the form that [`bdk_chain`] and `Wallet` can consume. | ![Electrum Crate Info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bdk_electrum.svg) ![Electrum API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs.rs-bdk_electrum-green) |
| [`bitcoind_rpc`](./crates/bitcoind_rpc) | Extends [`bitcoincore-rpc`] for emitting blockchain data from the `bitcoind` RPC interface in the form that [`bdk_chain`] and `Wallet` can consume. | ![BitcoinD RPC Crate Info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bdk_bitcoind_rpc.svg) ![BitcoinD RPC API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs.rs-bdk_bitcoind_rpc-green) |
| [`file_store`](./crates/file_store) | Persistence backend for storing chain data in a single file. Intended for testing and development purposes, not for production. | ![File Store Crate Info](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bdk_file_store.svg) ![File Store API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs.rs-bdk_file_store-green) |

The [`bdk_wallet`] repository and crate contains a higher level `Wallet` type that depends on the above lower-level mechanism crates.

Fully working examples of how to use these components are in `/examples`:

- [`example_cli`](examples/example_cli): Library used by the `example_*` crates. Provides utilities for syncing, showing the balance, generating addresses and creating transactions without using the bdk_wallet `Wallet`.
- [`example_electrum`](examples/example_electrum): A command line Bitcoin wallet application built on top of `example_cli` and the `electrum` crate. It shows the power of the bdk tools (`chain` + `file_store` + `electrum`), without depending on the main `bdk_wallet` library.
- [`example_esplora`](examples/example_esplora): A command line Bitcoin wallet application built on top of `example_cli` and the `esplora` crate. It shows the power of the bdk tools (`chain` + `file_store` + `esplora`), without depending on the main `bdk_wallet` library.
- [`example_bitcoind_rpc_polling`](examples/example_bitcoind_rpc_polling): A command line Bitcoin wallet application built on top of `example_cli` and the `bitcoind_rpc` crate. It shows the power of the bdk tools (`chain` + `file_store` + `bitcoind_rpc`), without depending on the main `bdk_wallet` library.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The following BDK crates maintains a MSRV of 1.63.0. To build these crates with the MSRV of 1.63.0 you will need to pin dependencies by running the [`pin-msrv.sh`](./ci/pin-msrv.sh) script.

- `bdk_core`
- `bdk_chain`
- `bdk_bitcoind_rpc`
- `bdk_esplora`
- `bdk_file_store`

The MSRV of the `bdk_electrum` crate is 1.75.0.

## Just

This project has a [`justfile`](/justfile) for easy command running. You must have [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) installed.

To see a list of available recipes: `just`

## Troubleshooting Tests

If tests are failing with `cargo test` it could be an issue related to tests that use bitcoind or electrsd running in parallel. This is known to affect MacOS users running tests locally. To force tests to run in series you can try:

```
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

or

```
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
```
