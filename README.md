# The Bitcoin Dev Kit

The `bdk` libraries aims to be the core building block for Bitcoin wallets of any kind.

The Bitcoin Dev Kit developers are in the process of releasing `v1.0` which is a fundamental
re-write of how the library works.

See for some background on this project: https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/road-to-bdk-1/ (ignore the timeline üòÅ)

For a release timeline see the [`bdk_core_staging`] repo where a lot of the component work is being done. The plan is that everything in the `bdk_core_staging` repo will be moved into the `crates` directory here.
