### Checklist

Release numbering must follow [Semantic Versioning]. These steps assume the current `master`
branch **development** version is *MAJOR.MINOR.0*.

#### On the day of the feature freeze

Change the `master` branch to the next MINOR+1 version:

- [ ] Switch to the `master` branch.
- [ ] Create a new PR branch called `bump_dev_MAJOR_MINOR+1`, eg. `bump_dev_0_22`.
- [ ] Bump the `bump_dev_MAJOR_MINOR+1` branch to the next development MINOR+1 version.
  - Change the `Cargo.toml` version value to `MAJOR.MINOR+1.0`.
  - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
  - The commit message should be "Bump version to MAJOR.MINOR+1.0".
- [ ] Create PR and merge the `bump_dev_MAJOR_MINOR+1` branch to `master`.
  - Title PR "Bump version to MAJOR.MINOR+1.0".

Create a new release branch and release candidate tag:

- [ ] Double check that your local `master` is up-to-date with the upstream repo.
- [ ] Create a new branch called `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` from `master`.
- [ ] Bump the `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` branch to `MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.1` version.
  - Change the `Cargo.toml` version value to `MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.1`.
  - The commit message should be "Bump version to MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.1".
- [ ] Add a tag to the `HEAD` commit in the `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` branch.
  - The tag name should be `vMAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.1`
  - Use message "Release MAJOR.MINOR+1.0 rc.1".
  - Make sure the tag is signed, for extra safety use the explicit `--sign` flag.
- [ ] Push the `release/MAJOR.MINOR` branch and new tag to the `bitcoindevkit/bdk` repo.
  - Use `git push --tags` option to push the new `vMAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.1` tag.

If any issues need to be fixed before the *MAJOR.MINOR+1.0* version is released:

- [ ] Merge fix PRs to the `master` branch.
- [ ] Git cherry-pick fix commits to the `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` branch.
- [ ] Verify fixes in `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` branch.
- [ ] Bump the `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` branch to `MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.x+1` version.
  - Change the `Cargo.toml` version value to `MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.x+1`.
  - The commit message should be "Bump version to MAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.x+1".
- [ ] Add a tag to the `HEAD` commit in the `release/MAJOR.MINOR+1` branch.
  - The tag name should be `vMAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.x+1`, where x is the current release candidate number.
  - Use tag message "Release MAJOR.MINOR+1.0 rc.x+1".
  - Make sure the tag is signed, for extra safety use the explicit `--sign` flag.
- [ ] Push the new tag to the `bitcoindevkit/bdk` repo.
  - Use `git push --tags` option to push the new `vMAJOR.MINOR+1.0-rc.x+1` tag.
