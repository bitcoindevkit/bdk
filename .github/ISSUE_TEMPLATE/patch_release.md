### On the day of the patch release

Change the `master` branch to the new PATCH+1 version:

- [ ] Switch to the `master` branch.
- [ ] Create a new PR branch called `bump_dev_MAJOR_MINOR_PATCH+1`, eg. `bump_dev_0_22_1`.
- [ ] Bump the `bump_dev_MAJOR_MINOR` branch to the next development PATCH+1 version.
  - Change the `Cargo.toml` version value to `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+1`.
  - Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
  - The commit message should be "Bump version to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+1".
- [ ] Create PR and merge the `bump_dev_MAJOR_MINOR_PATCH+1` branch to `master`.
  - Title PR "Bump version to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+1".

Cherry-pick, tag and publish new PATCH+1 release:

- [ ] Merge fix PRs to the `master` branch.
- [ ] Git cherry-pick fix commits to the `release/MAJOR.MINOR` branch to be patched.

  - The first line of the tag message should be "Release MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+1".
  - In the body of the tag message put a copy of the **Summary** and **Changelog** for the release.

  - In the release notes body put the **Summary** and **Changelog**.
  - Use the "+ Auto-generate release notes" button to add details from included PRs.
  - Until we reach a `1.0.0` release check the "Pre-release" box.
- [ ] Make sure the new release shows up on [crates.io] and that the docs are built correctly on [docs.rs].
- [ ] Announce the release, using the **Summary**, on Discord, Twitter and Mastodon.
- [ ] Celebrate ðŸŽ‰
