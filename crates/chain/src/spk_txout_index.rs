/// An index storing [`TxOut`]s that have a script pubkey that matches those in a list.
///
/// The basic idea is that you insert script pubkeys you care about into the index with
/// [`insert_spk`] and then when you call [`scan`] the index will look at any txouts you pass in and
/// store and index any txouts matching one of its script pubkeys.
///
/// Each script pubkey is associated with a application defined index script index `I` which must be
/// [`Ord`]. Usually this is used to associate the derivation index of the script pubkey or even a
/// combination of `(keychain, derivation_index)`.
///
/// Note there is no harm in scanning transactions that disappear from the blockchain or were never
/// in there in the first place. `SpkTxOutIndex` is intentionally *monotone* -- you cannot delete or
/// modify txouts that have been indexed. To find out which txouts from the index are actually in the
/// chain or unspent etc you must use other sources of information like a [`SparseChain`].
