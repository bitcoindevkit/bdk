//! This crate is used for emitting blockchain data from the `bitcoind` RPC interface. It does not
//! use the wallet RPC API, so this crate can be used with wallet-disabled Bitcoin Core nodes.
//!
//! [`Emitter`] is the main structure which sources blockchain data from [`bitcoincore_rpc::Client`].
//!
//! To only get block updates (exclude mempool transactions), the caller can use
//! [`Emitter::next_block`] or/and [`Emitter::next_header`] until it returns `Ok(None)` (which means
//! the chain tip is reached). A separate method, [`Emitter::mempool`] can be used to emit the whole
//! mempool.
